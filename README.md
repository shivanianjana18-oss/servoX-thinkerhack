# [python beginner helper] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: ServoX

### Team Members
- Member 1: Shivani A - Toc h institute of science and technology
- Member 2: Irine George - Toc h institute of science and technology

### Hosted Project Link
https://servo-x-thinkerhack.vercel.app/

### Project Description
Our website makes coding easy, friendly, understandable, and stress-free for students.The student types their Python code directly into the website. When they click the run button, the website executes the code in the background. If the program runs successfully, the output is displayed. However, if an error occurs, the system automatically detects the type of error generated

### The Problem statement
Many students struggle to understand Python errors.Error messages are technical and confusing.Beginners feel frustrated and lose interest.Teachers cannot help every student instantly.

### The Solution
Allows students to type Python code.Runs the code.Detects errors.Explains errors in simple English language

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used: python,HTML,CSS,flask
- Frameworks used: flask
- Libraries used: flask,sys,io
- Tools used: Visual Studio Code, python, flask, wb browser, command prompt/poweshell


## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Feature 1: Instant Code Execution

Once the student clicks the “Run” button, the website immediately executes the code in the background. This gives instant results, helping students quickly understand whether their code works or not.
- Feature 2: Automatic Error Detection

If there is a mistake in the code, the system automatically detects the error. It identifies common Python errors such as syntax mistakes, undefined variables, wrong data type usage, and indentation issues.
- Feature 3: Beginner-Friendly Error Explanation

Instead of showing complex technical error messages, the website converts them into simple and easy English. This helps students understand what went wrong without getting confused by programming terminology
- Feature 4: Clear Output Display

If the code runs successfully, the output is shown clearly on the webpage. If there is no output, the system informs the student that the code executed successfully.

The user flow of our application is designed to be simple, clear, and beginner-friendly. When a student opens the website, they are presented with a clean interface containing a code editor and a “Run” button. The student types their Python code directly into the editor. Once they finish writing the code, they click the “Run” button to execute it.
